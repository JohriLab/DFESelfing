# DFESelfing

>>SFS.zip
Has the SFS for simulations performed for 3 different DFEs - DFE1, DFE2, DFE3.
*_m1_count.sfs files have the neutral SFS for classes 1/100 to 99/100.
*_m1_count.fixed files have the number of fixed neutral alleles, which is equivalent to the 100/100 class.
*_m2_count.sfs files have the selected SFS for classes 1/100 to 99/100.
*_m2_count.fixed files have the number of fixed selected alleles, which is equivalent to the 100/100 class.
