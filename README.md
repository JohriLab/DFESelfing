# DFESelfing

>>Total number of neutral and selected sites in exons:
Number of neutral sites = Number of genes simulated (500) x Number of exons per gene (6) x exon length (250) x Proportion of neutral mutations (0.25)
Number of selected sites = Number of genes simulated (500) x Number of exons per gene (6) x exon length (250) x Proportion of selected mutations (0.75)

>>SFS.zip\
Has the SFS for simulations performed for 3 different DFEs - DFE1, DFE2, DFE3.\
*_m1_count.sfs files have the neutral SFS for classes 1/100 to 99/100.\
*_m1_count.fixed files have the number of fixed neutral alleles, which is equivalent to the 100/100 class.\
*_m2_count.sfs files have the selected SFS for classes 1/100 to 99/100.\
*_m2_count.fixed files have the number of fixed selected alleles, which is equivalent to the 100/100 class.\
